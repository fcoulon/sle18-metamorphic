\section{Open Questions \& Next Steps}
\label{sec:discussion}
From the language designers and users points of view, the rigidity of SLE must be fought.
In this paper, we have stressed the importance of shape-diverse DSLs and have proposed a first prototype approach, \prism, towards this vision.
Below, we list some open questions that arose during our first experiments, as well as a list of research problems to address in the future.

\paragraph{Open-world vs. Closed-world}

\paragraph{Patch formalism}
We do not really know if our patch formalism is sufficient; what if you want to connect another formalism; is there anything missing?
We donâ€™t care how patches are obtained. Diff is \emph{a} way to get there (as in the Rascal implementation), but obtaining the list of changes through other means (e.g., a transaction on a tree editor in EMF) is just as valid.

\paragraph{Automatic shape generation}
It may or may not be possible to automatically generate a shape from another.
In our prototype implementation, we are able to Ecore $\leftrightarrow$ Rascal.

\paragraph{Towards collaborative modeling}
Our dispatch is braindead. A smarter dispatch mechanism would enable collaborative editing, distributed synchronization, \etc;
We need a mechanism to valid produced Patches and their interpretations to detect desynchronization of incarnations (what should we do then? roll back? fix Patch?)

\paragraph{Challenges of internal DSLs}
Transforming context-heavy Java ASTs is challenging; our tool is stupid in that respect; DIY.

\paragraph{Towards metamorphic DSLs}
We view this initial contribution as a first step towards \emph{metamorphic DSLs}~\cite{acher2014metamorphic}.

\paragraph{LSP \& Monto}
\textbf{}

\paragraph{Others}
Our approach goes beyond what is described here. \eg synchronizing an outline view, a debugger, live modeling, w/e; also, we are AS-centric, but one could imagine something radically different;
Delta/edit scripts are known (ref?), ``pivot'' formalisms are---infamously---known, we combine both in a new context; why? what do we get from that?
